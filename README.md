## About The Project
![](shopping-cart.gif)

A simple Shopping Cart Application project developed in Android Studio (Java) that allows you to add items to cart, remove items to cart and display order checkout. In this project, I implemented OOP concepts and used multiple activities, layout (constraint, scroll, linear, and grid Layout), Intent, and RecyclerView components.

The purpose of this project is to do some exercises and apply what I have learned from the development of the first Android, Book 3rd edition (Chapters 1-13). There is one feature that doesn't work properly: updating the total price after the user removes an item from the cart, and may be fixed later.

### Built With
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/docs)
* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/)

## Getting Started

### Installation
To run the app, you have to sync the Gradle files first. Android Studio should automatically sync the project with Gradle when you robotify your app. If it does not, then you have to sync the Gradle files manually as follows:

1. Open your `gradle.properties` file in Android Studio.
2. Click Sync **Project with Gradle Files** to sync your project.
